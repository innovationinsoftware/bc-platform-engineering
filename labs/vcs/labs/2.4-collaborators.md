# Lab 2.4: Collaborating with Team Members

Everything you've learned so far has been solo work—creating your own repositories, making changes, and managing your own code. But the real power of Git and GitHub comes from collaboration. In the real world, you'll work with teammates on the same codebase, review each other's code, and coordinate changes.

In this lab, you'll work in pairs to practice real-world collaboration workflows. You'll add each other as collaborators, clone each other's repositories, create branches, submit pull requests, review code, and merge changes—exactly as you would on a professional development team.

### Estimated Time: 45 Minutes

**Prerequisites:** 
- Complete Labs 1.1 through 2.2
- Have a partner to work with (pair up with a classmate)
- Both partners should have their `git_practice` repository on GitHub

## Part 1: Understanding Collaboration on GitHub

**What you'll learn:**
- How to add collaborators to your repository
- How to clone someone else's repository
- How to contribute to a project you don't own
- How to review and approve pull requests from teammates
- How to coordinate changes with others

**Real-world scenario:**
In professional environments, you'll rarely work alone. You'll be part of a team where:
- Multiple developers work on the same repository
- Code must be reviewed before merging
- Everyone follows the same branching workflow
- Communication and coordination are essential

## Part 2: Find Your Partner

**Before you begin:**

1. **Pair up with a classmate**
   - You'll need one partner for this lab
   - Ideally, sit near each other so you can communicate easily
   - If there's an odd number, one group can have three people

2. **Exchange GitHub usernames**
   - Tell your partner your GitHub username
   - Write down your partner's GitHub username
   - You'll need this to add them as a collaborator

3. **Decide on roles (you'll switch later)**
   - **Person A**: Will add Person B as a collaborator first
   - **Person B**: Will clone Person A's repository and make changes
   - After the first workflow, you'll switch roles

## Part 3: Adding a Collaborator (Person A)

1. Go to your `git_practice` repository on GitHub

2. Click on **Settings** (gear icon at the top)

3. In the left sidebar, click **Collaborators**
   - You may need to enter your GitHub password to confirm

4. Click the green **Add people** button

5. Enter your partner's GitHub username
   - Type their username in the search box
   - Click on their profile when it appears

6. Click **Add [username] to this repository**
   - An invitation is sent to your partner

## Part 4: Accepting the Invitation (Person B)

1. Check your email
   - Look for an email from GitHub with the subject "You've been added as a collaborator..."
   - Or check your GitHub notifications (bell icon at the top right)

2. Click the link in the email or notification

3. Click **Accept invitation**
   - You now have write access to Person A's repository!

**Verify collaboration access:**
- Person B should now see Person A's repository in their GitHub repositories list
- Person B can now push directly to Person A's repository

## Part 5: Cloning Your Partner's Repository (Person B)

**Important: Folder naming conflict warning**

Since both of you have a repository named `git_practice`, you need to clone it to a different folder to avoid conflicts.

1. Open VS Code

2. Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` / `Cmd+Shift+P`)

3. Type "Git: Clone" and select it

4. Paste Person A's repository URL
   - Go to Person A's repository on GitHub
   - Click the green **Code** button
   - Copy the HTTPS URL
   - Paste it in VS Code

5. **Choose a different location OR rename the folder**
   
   **Option 1: Different location**
   - Clone to a different folder like `~/Documents/partner-repo`
   
   **Option 2: Rename during clone**
   - VS Code will suggest the folder name `git_practice`
   - Change it to something like `git_practice-partner` or `git_practice-[partner-name]`
   - This keeps both repositories separate

6. Open the cloned repository in VS Code
   - Click **Open** when prompted
   - Trust the repository

7. Verify you're working on your partner's repository
   - Look at the files—they should be your partner's files
   - Check the terminal:
     ```bash
     git remote -v
     # Should show your partner's GitHub URL
     ```

## Part 6: Making Changes to Your Partner's Repository (Person B)

Now you'll make a contribution to Person A's project by following the proper workflow.

1. **Create a new branch**
   - Click the branch name in the Status Bar
   - Create new branch: `feature/partner-contribution-[yourname]`
   - Example: `feature/partner-contribution-jane`

2. **Make a meaningful change**
   
   Here are some ideas (choose one or be creative):
   - Add a new function to `calculator.py`
     ```python
     def percentage(value, percent):
         """Calculate percentage of a value"""
         return (value * percent) / 100
     ```
   - Create a new file `contributions.md`:
     ```markdown
     # Contributions
     
     ## [Your Name]
     - Added percentage function
     - Date: [Today's date]
     ```
   - Update the README with a "Contributors" section

3. **Commit your changes**
   - Stage your changes in Source Control
   - Write a clear commit message
   - Commit

4. **Push your branch**
   - Click the sync icon or publish the branch
   - The branch is now on Person A's repository on GitHub

5. **Create a Pull Request**
   - Go to Person A's repository on GitHub
   - You'll see: "Your recently pushed branches: feature/partner-contribution-[yourname]"
   - Click **Compare & pull request**
   - Fill out the PR:
     - **Title**: "Add [feature name] - contribution from [your name]"
     - **Description**: Explain what you added and why
   - Click **Create pull request**

6. **Notify your partner**
   - Tell Person A that you've created a PR
   - In real teams, the PR notification would go to the team automatically

## Part 7: Reviewing and Approving a Pull Request (Person A)

1. Go to your repository on GitHub

2. Click the **Pull requests** tab
   - You should see the PR from Person B

3. Click on the Pull Request

4. **Review the overview**
   - Read the title and description
   - Check which branch is being merged
   - Look at the commits (click the **Commits** tab)

5. **Review the code changes**
   - Click the **Files changed** tab
   - Read through the changes carefully
   - Think about:
     - Does the code make sense?
     - Is it well-written?
     - Are there any potential issues?
     - Does it follow good practices?

6. **Add review comments**
   - Click the **+** icon next to any line
   - Add a comment like:
     - "Great addition! This will be useful."
     - "Could you add a comment explaining this function?"
     - "Nice work on the documentation!"
   - Click **Start a review**

7. **Add more comments if desired**
   - You can comment on multiple lines
   - All comments are batched in your review

8. **Submit your review**
   - Click **Review changes** (top right)
   - Select **Approve**
   - Add a summary comment: "Looks good! Thanks for the contribution."
   - Click **Submit review**

9. **Merge the Pull Request**
   - Scroll to the bottom of the conversation
   - Click **Merge pull request**
   - Click **Confirm merge**
   - Optionally: Click **Delete branch** to clean up

10. **Thank your partner!**
    - Add a comment: "Merged! Thanks for your contribution!"

## Part 8: Syncing Changes Back to Local

**Person A: Update your local repository**

Your `main` branch on GitHub now has Person B's changes, but your local repository doesn't know about them yet.

1. Open your `git_practice` repository in VS Code

2. Make sure you're on the `main` branch
   - Check the Status Bar
   - Switch to `main` if needed

3. Pull the changes
   - Click the sync icon
   - Or use Source Control → Pull

4. Verify the changes
   - Open the files that Person B modified
   - You should see their contributions!

**Person B: Update your local repository (if you cloned)**

If you want to keep your cloned copy of Person A's repository up to date:

1. In VS Code, switch to `main` branch

2. Pull the changes
   - Your merged PR is now in main!

3. Delete your feature branch (optional)
   ```bash
   git branch -d feature/partner-contribution-[yourname]
   ```

## Part 9: Switch Roles and Repeat

Now it's time to switch roles and do the entire workflow again!

**Person B becomes the repository owner, Person A becomes the contributor.**

Follow Parts 3-8 with reversed roles:

1. **Person B**: Add Person A as a collaborator to your `git_practice` repository
2. **Person A**: Accept the invitation
3. **Person A**: Clone Person B's repository
   - **Remember to use a different folder name!**
   - Clone to `git_practice-[partner-name]` or a different location to avoid conflicts
4. **Person A**: Make a contribution
   - Create a branch: `feature/partner-contribution-[yourname]`
   - Make a meaningful change (different from what Person B did earlier)
   - Commit and push
   - Create a Pull Request
5. **Person B**: Review and merge
   - Review Person A's PR
   - Add comments
   - Approve the review
   - Merge the PR
6. **Both**: Sync your repositories
   - Pull the changes to your local `main` branches
   - Verify you both have each other's contributions

## Part 10: Practice Scenarios

If you have time, try these additional collaboration scenarios:

### Scenario 1: Multiple PRs at Once

- **Both**: Create different branches with different features
- **Both**: Create PRs at the same time
- **Both**: Review each other's PRs
- **Both**: Merge both PRs
- **Both**: Pull all changes

### Scenario 2: Requesting Changes

- **Person A**: Create a PR with an intentional "mistake" (like a typo or missing comment)
- **Person B**: Request changes in the review
- **Person A**: Make the requested changes and push to the same branch
- **Person B**: Review again and approve
- **Person B**: Merge the PR

### Scenario 3: Merge Conflict

- **Both**: Edit the same file in the same location on different branches
- **Both**: Create PRs
- **Person B**: Merge the first PR
- **Person A**: Try to merge the second PR
- **Notice**: GitHub will show a merge conflict
- **Together**: Resolve the conflict on GitHub or locally

## Part 10: Collaboration Best Practices

Based on what you've learned, here are professional collaboration guidelines:

### Communication
- **Always communicate** with your team before making major changes
- **Use PR descriptions** to explain your changes clearly
- **Respond to review comments** promptly and professionally
- **Tag teammates** in comments using @username when you need their input

### Branch Management
- **Create branches** for every feature or bug fix
- **Use descriptive names**: `feature/add-login`, `bugfix/fix-typo`
- **Keep branches short-lived**: Merge quickly, don't let them get stale
- **Delete branches** after merging to keep the repository clean 

### Pull Requests
- **Keep PRs focused**: One feature or fix per PR
- **Write clear descriptions**: Explain what, why, and how
- **Link to issues**: If using GitHub Issues, reference them in PRs
- **Request specific reviewers**: Don't just wait for anyone
- **Keep them small**: Easier to review than massive PRs

### Code Review
- **Be respectful**: Assume positive intent
- **Be specific**: "Consider using a for loop here" vs "This is wrong"
- **Explain why**: Help teammates learn
- **Praise good work**: Not just criticism
- **Review promptly**: Don't block your team

### Conflict Resolution
- **Pull frequently**: Stay up to date with main
- **Communicate about overlaps**: "Hey, I'm working on the login page too"
- **Resolve conflicts carefully**: Don't just pick one version blindly
- **Test after resolving**: Make sure everything still works

## Cleanup

**Both partners:**

You can keep the cloned repositories or delete them:

**To keep working together:**
- Keep each other as collaborators
- Continue practicing
- Use these repositories for future Git practice

**To remove collaborator access:**
- Repository owner: Settings → Collaborators → Remove

**To delete cloned partner repository:**
```bash
# On your computer, delete the folder
# In VS Code: File → Close Folder, then delete from file system
```

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've experienced real Git collaboration. You learned:

- **Collaboration setup**: Adding collaborators and managing repository access
- **Cloning repositories**: Working with code you don't own
- **Folder management**: Handling naming conflicts when cloning
- **Feature workflow**: Branch, commit, push, PR on someone else's repository
- **Code review**: Reviewing, commenting, approving, and requesting changes
- **Merging**: Integrating approved changes into the main branch
- **Synchronization**: Keeping local repositories up to date after merges
- **Communication**: Working with a partner throughout the process

**Key Takeaways:**

1. **Collaboration is a conversation**: Git and GitHub provide the tools, but communication makes teams successful

2. **Everyone can contribute**: Collaborators can create branches and PRs on repositories they don't own

3. **Review improves quality**: Code review catches bugs and spreads knowledge

4. **Coordination prevents conflicts**: Communication reduces merge conflicts

5. **Clean workflows matter**: Good branch naming, clear PR descriptions, and proper cleanup keep projects organized

## Next Steps

- Continue collaborating with your partner on small projects
- Practice the workflow until it feels natural
- Try more complex scenarios (multiple reviewers, discussion threads, etc.)
- Explore GitHub Organizations for managing team access
- Learn about protected branches and required reviews
- Consider contributing to open-source projects using this same workflow

## Reflection Questions

Discuss with your partner:

1. What was the most challenging part of collaborating?
2. How did code review help improve the changes?
3. What would you do differently next time?
4. How does this workflow compare to working alone?
5. What questions do you still have about Git collaboration?
