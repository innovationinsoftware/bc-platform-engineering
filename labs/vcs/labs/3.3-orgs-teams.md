# Lab 3.3: Organizations and Teams

## Introduction

So far, you've worked with repositories under your personal GitHub account. In professional environments, repositories usually belong to **Organizations**, and access is managed through **Teams**. This makes it easier to manage permissions across multiple repositories and team members.

**By the end of this reading, you will:**
- Understand the difference between personal accounts and organizations
- See how organizations manage multiple repositories
- Learn how teams simplify access management
- Understand how repositories inherit settings from organizations
- Know when to use personal accounts vs. organizations

**Estimated Time:** 20 minutes

## Part 1: Personal Accounts vs. Organizations

### What You've Been Using: Personal Account

Your GitHub account (e.g., `yourname`) is a **personal account**:
- Owns repositories
- Has its own settings
- You manage collaborators one-by-one per repository
- Free for unlimited public repositories
- Great for personal projects and learning

### What Is an Organization?

An **Organization** (e.g., `microsoft`, `google`, `your-company`) is:
- A shared account for teams/companies
- Owns repositories on behalf of the team
- Manages access through **Teams** instead of individual collaborators
- Has organization-wide settings that repositories inherit
- Used for professional and team projects

### Key Differences

| Feature | Personal Account | Organization |
|---------|-----------------|--------------|
| **Who owns it** | You | The team/company |
| **Repositories** | Your personal projects | Team/company projects |
| **Access management** | Add collaborators per repo | Create teams with repo access |
| **Settings** | Per repository | Organization-level + repository-level |
| **Cost** | Free (public repos) | Free or paid (GitHub Team/Enterprise) |
| **Use case** | Personal projects, learning | Professional teams, companies |

## Part 2: Exploring Organization Structure

Let's explore how organizations work (you'll observe, not create).

### Your Account as an "Org-Like" Structure

Even your personal account has some organization-like features:

1. Go to **your profile** on GitHub: `https://github.com/[your-username]`

2. Click the **Settings** gear icon (top right of your profile)

3. Notice the left sidebar - you'll see sections like:
   - **Public profile**
   - **Account**
   - **Repositories** ← Organization-like settings
   - **Organizations** ← Organizations you belong to

![Personal Account Settings - Sidebar](images/github-account-settings.png)

### Repository Settings vs. Account Settings

4. Go to one of your repositories → **Settings**

5. Notice: Repository settings are **specific to that repository**

6. Now go back to your **account settings** (click your profile picture → Settings)

7. Some settings here affect **all** your repositories:
   - Default repository permissions
   - Security settings
   - Email preferences

**This is how organizations work, but at a larger scale!**

---

## Part 3: How Organizations Use Teams

### The Problem Without Teams

Imagine a company with:
- 50 developers
- 100 repositories
- Each developer needs access to 10-20 repositories

**Without teams:**
- Add each developer as collaborator to each repository individually
- 50 developers × 20 repos = 1,000 individual permissions to manage!
- When someone joins/leaves, update 20+ repositories

**This is a nightmare to manage!**

### The Solution: Teams

Organizations create **Teams** (like groups):

**Example: Microsoft Organization**
- **Team: Frontend Developers**
  - Members: Alice, Bob, Carol
  - Access: All frontend repositories (Read/Write)
  
- **Team: Backend Developers**
  - Members: Dave, Eve, Frank
  - Access: All backend repositories (Write), all frontend repositories (Read)
  
- **Team: Admins**
  - Members: Grace, Henry
  - Access: All repositories (Admin)

**Benefits:**
- Add a repository to a team → everyone on the team gets access
- Add a person to a team → they get access to all team repositories
- Remove someone from team → loses access to all team repositories
- Manage 5 teams instead of 1,000 individual permissions

---

## Part 4: Organization Settings Inheritance

Organizations can set **default rules** that repositories inherit.

### Organization-Level Settings

Organizations can configure:

**Security & Analysis**
- Dependabot alerts for all repositories
- Secret scanning enabled by default
- Code scanning requirements

**Member Privileges**
- Default repository permissions (read, write)
- Who can create repositories
- Who can delete repositories
- Branch protection defaults

**Actions Permissions**
- Which GitHub Actions can run
- Workflow permissions
- Required workflows for all repositories

**Pages**
- GitHub Pages settings for organization

### How Repositories Inherit Settings

When you create a repository in an organization:

1. **Organization settings apply first**
   - Security features enabled automatically
   - Default permissions set
   - Required workflows run

2. **Repository can override some settings**
   - Add additional protection rules
   - Enable additional features
   - But can't disable organization requirements

**Example:**
- Org requires: "All PRs need 1 approval"
- Repository can add: "All PRs need 2 approvals"
- Repository cannot: Remove the approval requirement

This ensures **minimum standards** across all projects!

## Part 5: Viewing an Organization (Demo)

Let's look at a real organization to see this in action.

### Explore a Public Organization

1. Go to a popular open-source organization:
   - Microsoft: `https://github.com/microsoft`
   - Or Google: `https://github.com/google`
   - Or your company's GitHub org if you have access

2. Notice what you can see:
   - **Repositories** tab - all the org's repositories
   - **People** tab - organization members (if public)
   - **Teams** tab - may not be visible (often private)
   - Pinned repositories
   - Organization description and website

3. Click on any repository in the organization

4. Notice at the top:
   - Repository belongs to the **organization** (e.g., `microsoft/vscode`)
   - Not to an individual person

### What You Can't See (Unless You're a Member)

If you're not a member of the organization:
- Private repositories (hidden)
- Team structure (usually private)
- Organization settings
- Internal discussions

---

## Part 6: Being Part of an Organization

### How You Join an Organization

**Professional scenario:**
1. Your employer creates a GitHub organization
2. Admin invites you via your GitHub username or email
3. You receive an invitation
4. You accept the invitation
5. You're now a member!

### Your Organizations

1. Click your **profile picture** (top right)

2. Select **Your organizations**

3. You'll see:
   - Organizations you're a member of
   - Your role in each (Member, Owner, etc.)
   - Option to create a new organization

4. If you're part of any organizations, click on one

5. As a member, you'll see:
   - Repositories you have access to
   - Teams you're part of
   - Organization-wide discussions (if enabled)

## Part 7: When to Use Organizations

### Use a Personal Account When:

✅ Learning and experimenting.  
✅ Personal projects and portfolios.  
✅ Contributing to open source.  
✅ Solo development.  
✅ Homework and school projects.  

### Use an Organization When:

✅ Multiple people collaborate regularly.  
✅ Company/team repositories.  
✅ Need centralized access management.  
✅ Want organization-wide policies.   
✅ Professional branding (company name on repos).  
✅ Managing multiple projects as a team.  

### Creating a Free Organization

**You can create a free organization for:**
- Open-source projects
- Study groups
- Small teams
- Community projects

**Steps** (optional, for reference):
1. Click your profile picture → **Settings**
2. Click **Organizations** (left sidebar)
3. Click **New organization**
4. Choose a plan (Free for public repos)
5. Name your organization
6. Invite team members

**We won't create one now, but know it's an option!**

---

## Part 8: Teams in Action (Conceptual)

Since you likely don't have organization admin access, here's how teams work:

### Creating a Team (Organization Owners Only)

1. Go to organization → **Teams** tab
2. Click **New team**
3. Name the team (e.g., "Backend Developers")
4. Set privacy (Visible or Secret)
5. Add team members

### Giving a Team Access to Repositories

1. Go to repository → **Settings** → **Collaborators and teams**
2. Click **Add teams**
3. Select a team (e.g., "Backend Developers")
4. Choose permission level:
   - **Read**: View and clone
   - **Triage**: Manage issues and PRs
   - **Write**: Push to repository
   - **Maintain**: Manage repository (no sensitive settings)
   - **Admin**: Full control

5. Click **Add**

Now **everyone on that team** has access!

### Benefits You See as a Team Member

- Added to team → instant access to all team repositories
- Don't need individual invitations to each repo
- Team discussions for collaboration
- Clear visibility of who's on your team
- Simplified onboarding/offboarding

## Part 9: Repository Settings in Organizations

### What's Different in Org Repositories

When you view Settings on an organization repository:

1. **Collaborators and teams** tab (not just Collaborators)
   - Individual collaborators listed
   - Teams listed separately
   - Teams can have different permission levels

2. **Branches** tab shows:
   - Repository-specific rules
   - May mention organization requirements
   - Some settings locked by organization

3. **Actions** tab shows:
   - Organization-wide policies
   - What you can/can't override

4. **Security** tab shows:
   - Organization security policies
   - Inherited settings (may be locked)

### Locked Settings

Some settings show a 🔒 lock icon:
- Means the organization enforces this setting
- You cannot disable it at repository level
- Ensures compliance with company policies

## Part 10: Personal Access Tokens

### Why Applications Need Tokens

When applications need to access GitHub on your behalf (CI/CD tools, deployment platforms, bots), they can't use your password. Instead, they use **Personal Access Tokens (PATs)**.

**What is a Personal Access Token?**
- Like a password, but safer
- You control what it can access (specific permissions)
- Can be revoked anytime
- Can have expiration dates
- Different tokens for different apps

**Common uses:**
- GitHub Actions workflows
- Deployment tools (Heroku, Netlify)
- Using Git with HTTPS from command line
- Automation scripts and bots

### Creating a Token (Quick Overview)

1. Click your **profile picture** → **Settings**
2. Scroll to **Developer settings** (bottom of left sidebar)
3. Click **Personal access tokens** → **Tokens (classic)**
4. Click **Generate new token**

5. Configure:
   - **Note**: Give it a descriptive name
   - **Expiration**: Set an expiration (7, 30, 60, 90 days)
   - **Scopes**: Select what it can access (e.g., `repo` for repository access)

6. Click **Generate token**

7. **Copy the token immediately!** You won't see it again.

### Security Best Practices

✅ **Do:**
- Store tokens securely (password manager)
- Set expiration dates
- Use minimum required permissions
- Revoke tokens when no longer needed

❌ **Don't:**
- Commit tokens to repositories
- Share tokens publicly
- Use the same token everywhere

**If exposed:** Revoke immediately in Developer settings!
