# Lab 2.3: Tags and Releases

## Introduction

As your project evolves, you'll reach important milestones - version 1.0, major updates, bug fixes. **Tags** and **Releases** help you mark these milestones and provide downloadable snapshots of your code at specific points in time.

**By the end of this lab, you will:**
- Understand what tags are and why they're useful
- Create tags from the command line and GitHub
- Understand the difference between tags and branches
- Create a GitHub Release
- Add release notes and attach files
- Know when to use tags and releases

**Estimated Time:** 25 minutes

## Part 1: Understanding Tags

### What Is a Tag?

A **tag** is a pointer to a specific commit, like a bookmark in your Git history.

**Think of it like:**
- A snapshot of your code at a specific moment
- A label that says "This is version 1.0"
- A permanent marker that doesn't change

### Tags vs. Branches

| Feature | Branch | Tag |
|---------|--------|-----|
| **Points to** | A commit (moves forward) | A commit (stays fixed) |
| **Changes** | Gets new commits | Never changes |
| **Purpose** | Active development | Mark a milestone |
| **Example** | `main`, `feature/login` | `v1.0.0`, `v2.1.3` |

**Key difference:** Branches grow and change, tags are permanent markers.

### Why Use Tags?

**Version tracking**
- Mark releases: v1.0.0, v2.0.0, v2.1.0
- Easy to find "what was the code in version 1.0?"

**Deployment markers**
- Tag what's deployed to production
- Easy rollback: "Deploy tag v1.2.3"

**Clear history**
- See major milestones at a glance
- Better than searching through commits

**Release management**
- GitHub creates releases from tags
- Users can download specific versions

### Common Tag Naming Conventions

**Semantic Versioning (most common):**
- `v1.0.0` - Major version 1, minor 0, patch 0
- `v1.2.0` - Added features (minor version)
- `v1.2.1` - Bug fixes (patch version)

**Other conventions:**
- `release-2024-11-02` - Date-based
- `prod-deployment-123` - Deployment markers
- `milestone-beta` - Milestone names

## Part 2: Creating Tags from Command Line

Let's create tags for your `git_practice` repository.

### Lightweight Tags

1. Open Git Bash or your terminal

2. Navigate to your repository:
   ```bash
   cd ~/Documents/GitHub/git_practice
   ```

3. Make sure you're on `main` and up to date:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull
   ```

4. View your current tags (probably none yet):
   ```bash
   git tag
   ```

5. Create a lightweight tag for your current version:
   ```bash
   git tag v1.0.0
   ```

6. View your tags again:
   ```bash
   git tag
   ```
   
   You should see `v1.0.0` listed.

### Annotated Tags (Recommended)

Annotated tags include extra information: who created it, when, and a message.

7. Create an annotated tag:
   ```bash
   git tag -a v1.0.1 -m "First release with all features"
   ```

8. View tag details:
   ```bash
   git show v1.0.1
   ```
   
   You'll see:
   - Tag name
   - Tagger (your name)
   - Date
   - Message
   - Commit information

### Pushing Tags to GitHub

Tags are **local** until you push them!

9. Push a specific tag:
   ```bash
   git push origin v1.0.1
   ```

10. Or push all tags at once:
    ```bash
    git push origin --tags
    ```

### Viewing Tags on GitHub

11. Go to your repository on GitHub

12. Click on the **branch dropdown** (shows "main" by default)

13. Click the **Tags** tab


14. You should see your tags (`v1.0.0`, `v1.0.1`)

15. Click on a tag to see the code at that point in time

## Part 3: Creating a GitHub Release

Releases are GitHub's way of packaging tags with release notes, files, and downloads.

### What Is a Release?

A **GitHub Release** is:
- Built on top of a tag
- Includes release notes (what changed)
- Can include downloadable files (binaries, docs, etc.)
- Shows up on your repository's main page
- Notifies watchers of new versions

### Create Your First Release

1. On your repository page, click **Releases** (right sidebar)
   - Or go to: `https://github.com/[username]/git_practice/releases`


2. Click **Create a new release** (or **Draft a new release**)

3. **Choose a tag:**
   - Click the tag dropdown
   - Select `v1.0.1` (the tag you created earlier)
   - Or type a new tag like `v1.1.0` to create it now


4. **Release title:** 
   ```
   Version 1.0 - Initial Release
   ```

5. **Describe this release:** Add release notes in Markdown:
   ```markdown
   ## What's New in v1.0
   
   This is the first official release of our Git practice project!
   
   ### Features
   - Basic README with project description
   - Sample Python script (hello.py)
   - Proper .gitignore configuration
   - Wiki documentation
   
   ### Contributors
   Thanks to everyone who helped with this release!
   
   ### Installation
   Clone the repository and follow the README instructions.
   ```


6. **Attach binaries** (optional):
   - Click **Attach binaries by dropping them here**
   - You could upload compiled programs, ZIP files, documentation PDFs
   - For this lab, skip this step

7. **Additional options:**
   - Set as a pre-release (for beta versions)
   - Set as the latest release (usually auto-selected)
   - Create a discussion for this release (optional)

8. Click **Publish release**

### View Your Release

9. You'll be taken to the release page

10. Notice what GitHub automatically provides:
    - **Source code (zip)** - Download link
    - **Source code (tar.gz)** - Download link
    - Release notes
    - Tag information
    - Commit SHA


11. Go back to your repository's main page

12. The release shows up:
    - In the sidebar under "Releases"
    - With a count (e.g., "1 release")

---

## Part 4: Managing Tags and Releases

### Creating Tags for Specific Commits

You can tag older commits, not just the current one:

1. Find the commit SHA you want to tag:
   ```bash
   git log --oneline
   ```

2. Tag that specific commit:
   ```bash
   git tag -a v0.9.0 abc1234 -m "Beta version"
   ```
   
   Replace `abc1234` with the actual commit SHA.

3. Push the tag:
   ```bash
   git push origin v0.9.0
   ```

### Deleting Tags

**Delete locally:**
```bash
git tag -d v1.0.0
```

**Delete on GitHub:**
```bash
git push origin --delete v1.0.0
```

**Warning:** Deleting a tag that has a release will break the release link!

### Updating a Release

1. Go to your repository's **Releases** page

2. Find the release you want to update

3. Click **Edit release** (pencil icon)

4. Update the notes, add files, or change settings

5. Click **Update release**

## Part 5: Practical Release Workflow

Here's how releases are used in real projects:

### Scenario 1: New Feature Release

1. Develop features on branches
2. Merge to `main` when ready
3. Test thoroughly
4. Create a tag: `git tag -a v1.1.0 -m "Added user login"`
5. Push tag: `git push origin v1.1.0`
6. Create GitHub Release with notes about new features
7. Users download v1.1.0

### Scenario 2: Bug Fix Release

1. Fix critical bug
2. Merge fix to `main`
3. Create a patch tag: `git tag -a v1.1.1 -m "Fixed login bug"`
4. Push tag: `git push origin v1.1.1`
5. Create GitHub Release noting the bug fix
6. Users can update to v1.1.1

### Scenario 3: Major Version Release

1. Complete major rewrite on branch
2. Extensive testing
3. Merge to `main`
4. Create tag: `git tag -a v2.0.0 -m "Major redesign"`
5. Push tag
6. Create detailed GitHub Release with:
   - **Breaking changes** highlighted
   - Migration guide
   - New features list
   - Known issues

### Release Notes Best Practices

**Good release notes include:**

**What's new:** New features
**What's fixed:** Bug fixes
**Breaking changes:** Things that might break existing code
**Migration guide:** How to upgrade from previous version
**Contributors:** Thank people who helped
**Known issues:** What still needs work

**Template:**
```markdown
## What's New
- Feature 1
- Feature 2

## Bug Fixes
- Fixed issue #123
- Fixed crash when...

## Breaking Changes
**WARNING:** The API endpoint changed from /api/v1 to /api/v2

## Upgrade Guide
1. Update your imports
2. Run migration script
3. Test thoroughly

## Contributors
Thanks to @alice, @bob, and @carol!

## Part 6: Tags and Releases in Team Workflows

### When Teams Use Releases

**Production deployments:**
- Tag production releases: `prod-v1.2.3`
- Deploy that specific tag to production
- Easy to rollback: deploy the previous tag

**Customer versions:**
- Customer A uses v2.1.0
- Customer B uses v2.0.5
- Easy to see what each customer has

**Documentation:**
- Each release has documentation
- Users can find docs for their version

**Bug tracking:**
- "Bug found in v1.2.0, fixed in v1.2.1"
- Clear version tracking

### Versioning Strategy

**Semantic Versioning (SemVer):**
- `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` (e.g., 2.1.3)
- **MAJOR**: Breaking changes (v1.0 → v2.0)
- **MINOR**: New features, backward compatible (v1.0 → v1.1)
- **PATCH**: Bug fixes (v1.0.0 → v1.0.1)

**Example:**
- `v1.0.0` - Initial release
- `v1.0.1` - Bug fix
- `v1.1.0` - New feature added
- `v1.1.1` - Another bug fix
- `v2.0.0` - Major rewrite (breaking changes)

---

## Part 7: Checking Out Tags

### View Code at a Specific Tag

You can "time travel" to see what the code looked like at a tagged version:

1. List available tags:
   ```bash
   git tag
   ```

2. Checkout a specific tag:
   ```bash
   git checkout v1.0.0
   ```

3. You're now in "detached HEAD" state:
   - You're looking at old code
   - Don't make commits here
   - Just explore

4. Return to main:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   ```

### Create a Branch from a Tag

If you need to fix a bug in an old version:

1. Checkout the tag:
   ```bash
   git checkout v1.0.0
   ```

2. Create a branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b hotfix-v1.0.1
   ```

3. Make your fix and commit

4. Tag the fix:
   ```bash
   git tag -a v1.0.1 -m "Hotfix for v1.0"
   ```

5. Push the branch and tag:
   ```bash
   git push origin hotfix-v1.0.1
   git push origin v1.0.1
   ```

---

## Cleanup

No cleanup needed! Keep your tags and releases - they're part of your project history.

**Optional:** Delete the practice tags if you want:
```bash
git tag -d v1.0.0
git push origin --delete v1.0.0
```
