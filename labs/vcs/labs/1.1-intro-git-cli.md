# Introduction to Git Bash

Git Bash is a command-line interface for Windows that provides Git commands along with common Unix/Linux utilities. For many Windows users, Git Bash offers their first experience with a Unix-like command-line environment, making it an essential tool for developers and system administrators.

Understanding Git Bash fundamentals prepares you for both version control workflows and cross-platform system administration. The commands you learn here work identically on Linux and macOS, making your skills transferable across operating systems.

### Estimated Time: 20 Minutes

## Part 1: Understanding Git Bash Basics

Git Bash runs on Windows but behaves like a Linux terminal. Let's explore basic navigation and file operations.

1. Open Git Bash on your Windows machine
   - Search for "Git Bash" in the Start menu
   - Right-click and select "Run as Administrator" if needed
   - You should see a terminal window with a `$` prompt

2. Print your current working directory
   ```
   pwd
   ```

   This shows your current location in the file system. By default, Git Bash starts in your Windows home directory.

3. Understand path translation
   ```
   # Git Bash shows Windows paths with forward slashes
   # C:\Users\YourName becomes /c/Users/YourName
   
   # View your Windows home directory
   echo $HOME
   
   # List files in your current directory
   ls
   ```

4. Navigate to your Documents folder
   ```
   # Navigate to Documents
   cd Documents
   
   # Verify your location
   pwd
   
   # List contents
   ls -la
   ```

## Part 2: Creating Directories and Files

Let's practice creating directories and files using Unix commands in Git Bash.

1. Create a new directory for your Git practice
   ```
   # Create a directory called git_practice
   mkdir git_practice
   
   # Verify it was created
   ls
   ```

2. Navigate into the new directory
   ```
   cd git_practice
   
   # Check where you are
   pwd
   ```

3. Create a nested directory structure
   ```
   # Create parent and child directories in one command
   mkdir -p projects/web-app
   
   # View the structure
   ls -la
   ls -la projects/
   ```

4. Create your first file
   ```
   # Create an empty file
   touch README.md
   
   # Verify it exists
   ls -la
   ```

5. Add content to the file
   ```
   # Echo text into the file
   echo "# My First Git Repository" > README.md
   
   # View the file contents
   cat README.md
   
   # Append more content
   echo "This is a practice repository for learning Git." >> README.md
   
   # View updated contents
   cat README.md
   ```

## Part 3: Initializing a Git Repository

Now let's turn this directory into a Git repository—the foundation of version control.

1. Initialize a Git repository
   ```
   git init
   ```

   You should see: "Initialized empty Git repository in ..."

2. View the hidden `.git` folder
   ```
   # List all files including hidden ones
   ls -la
   
   # You'll see a .git directory
   # The . prefix makes it hidden (Unix convention)
   ```

3. Explore what Git created
   ```
   # Look inside the .git directory
   ls -la .git
   
   # This folder contains all Git metadata
   # HEAD, config, objects, refs, etc.
   ```

4. Check Git repository status
   ```
   git status
   ```

   Notice Git recognizes your README.md as an "untracked file"

## Part 4: Basic Git Workflow

Let's perform your first Git workflow: staging and committing changes. make sure you use the username and email that matches your GitHub account for future labs.

1. Configure Git with your identity (first time only)
   ```
   # Set your name
   git config --global user.name "Your Name"
   
   # Set your email
   git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
   
   # View your configuration
   git config --list
   ```

2. Stage your README.md file
   ```
   # Add the file to the staging area
   git add README.md
   
   # Check status
   git status
   ```

   Notice README.md is now under "Changes to be committed"

3. Commit your changes
   ```
   # Commit with a message
   git commit -m "Initial commit: Add README"
   
   # View the commit
   git log
   ```

4. Make more changes and commit again
   ```
   # Create another file
   echo "print('Hello, Git!')" > hello.py
   
   # Check status
   git status
   
   # Add and commit in one workflow
   git add hello.py
   git commit -m "Add hello.py script"
   
   # View commit history
   git log --oneline
   ```

## Part 5: Understanding File States in Git

Files in a Git repository can exist in different states. Understanding these is crucial for version control.

1. Create a new file and observe states
   ```
   # Create a new file
   echo "# Project Notes" > notes.txt
   
   # Status: Untracked
   git status
   ```

2. Stage the file
   ```
   # Add to staging area
   git add notes.txt
   
   # Status: Staged (ready to commit)
   git status
   ```

3. Modify the staged file
   ```
   # Modify the file
   echo "- Remember to push changes" >> notes.txt
   
   # Status: Both staged AND modified
   git status
   ```

   Notice Git shows the file in two states!

4. View differences
   ```
   # See what changed since staging
   git diff notes.txt
   
   # See what's staged for commit
   git diff --cached notes.txt
   ```

5. Stage all changes and commit
   ```
   # Add all changes
   git add --all
   
   # Commit everything
   git commit -m "Add project notes"
   
   # Clean status
   git status
   ```

## Part 6: Ignoring Files with .gitignore

Sometimes you don't want Git to track certain files—like passwords, API keys, or temporary files. The `.gitignore` file tells Git which files to ignore.

1. Create a file with sensitive information
   ```
   # Create a .env file (commonly used for environment variables/secrets)
   echo "API_KEY=super-secret-key-12345" > .env
   echo "DATABASE_PASSWORD=my-password" >> .env
   
   # Check Git status
   git status
   ```

   Notice Git sees `.env` as an untracked file. We don't want to commit this!

2. Create a `.gitignore` file
   ```
   # Create .gitignore file
   echo ".env" > .gitignore
   
   # Check status again
   git status
   ```

   Now `.env` is ignored, but `.gitignore` is tracked!

3. View the `.gitignore` file
   ```
   # View in terminal
   cat .gitignore
   
   # You can also open it in Notepad or any text editor
   # Just navigate to your git_practice folder in Windows Explorer
   # Right-click .gitignore and choose "Open with Notepad"
   ```

4. Add more patterns to `.gitignore`
   ```
   # Add common patterns (you can edit in Notepad or use echo)
   echo "*.log" >> .gitignore
   echo "temp/" >> .gitignore
   echo "node_modules/" >> .gitignore
   
   # View the file
   cat .gitignore
   ```

   **Common `.gitignore` patterns:**
   - `.env` - Environment variables file
   - `*.log` - All log files
   - `temp/` - Temporary directory
   - `node_modules/` - Node.js dependencies
   - `*.exe` - Compiled executables

5. Commit the `.gitignore` file
   ```
   git add .gitignore
   git commit -m "Add .gitignore to exclude sensitive files"
   
   # Verify .env is still ignored
   git status
   ```

6. Test that ignored files are truly ignored
   ```
   # Create a log file
   echo "Error: Something went wrong" > app.log
   
   # Check status
   git status
   ```

   Notice `app.log` doesn't appear—it's ignored!

**Important:** You can edit `.gitignore` (or any text file) using:
- **Notepad**: Right-click the file in Windows Explorer → "Open with Notepad"
- **VS Code**: If installed, right-click → "Open with Code"
- **Any text editor**: Notepad++, Sublime Text, etc.
- **Git Bash**: Use `echo` or `vi` (if you know how)

## Part 7: Git Bash Tips for Windows Users

Understanding differences between Git Bash and Windows helps avoid confusion.

1. Editing files with Windows applications
   ```
   # You can open any file in Notepad from Git Bash
   notepad README.md
   
   # Or open the current folder in Windows Explorer
   explorer .
   ```

   **Tip:** Use Windows tools when you're more comfortable! Git Bash commands and Windows applications work together.

2. Path differences
   ```
   # Windows path: C:\Users\YourName\Documents
   # Git Bash path: /c/Users/YourName/Documents
   
   # You can access Windows drives
   ls /c/
   ls /d/  # If you have D: drive
   ```

3. Home directory shortcut
   ```
   # ~ represents your home directory
   cd ~
   pwd
   
   # Go back to git_practice
   cd ~/Documents/git_practice
   ```

4. Clear the screen
   ```
   # Clear terminal output
   clear
   ```

5. View command history
   ```
   # See previous commands
   history
   
   # Use up/down arrows to navigate history
   ```

6. Tab completion
   ```
   # Type "cd git_" and press Tab
   # Git Bash will auto-complete
   ```

**Warning:** `rm -rf` permanently deletes files without a recycle bin. Use carefully!
